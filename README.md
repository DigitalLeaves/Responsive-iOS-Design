# Responsive iOS Design

Responsive iOS Design is a set of classes to show how to develop and implement a responsive iOS Design. It serves as code source and examples for the article [Towards Responsive iOS Design](http://digitalleaves.com/blog/towards-responsive-ios-design-beyond-size-classes-and-auto-layout-i/). The article deals with adaptive interfaces that respond not only in its basic layout and visual element, but in a fully responsive way to reach a full adaptation to every device screen, orientation, size and concrete constraints.

The source code contains adaptive UITableViews and UICollectionViews that render their cells depending on the size class and layout of the presenting device. It tries to reach far beyond Autolayout and Size Classes.

# Use

The classes are presented as examples. You just have to run the project in the simulator or your device. You will need Xcode6 Beta 6 or up and iOS 8 Beta.
